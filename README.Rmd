# gdalosx

The goal of gdalosx is to find out how to use travis to test a GDAL-dependent R package on OSX. GDAL has a [pretty comprehensive CI test suite](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/tree/trunk/gdal/ci/travis) that I'm using as a guide. 

Currently my build matrix is only trusty (Ubuntu 14.04) and xcode8 (OSX), just so I know it works in both environments. I know really nothing about OSX so this is helpful for knowing that we can support that platform for various R projects. 

The R package here doesn't do anything interesting, the crux here is the .travis.yml and the badges in the readme.
